# Cube Runner Game

A simple 3D browser game where the player controls a cube to dodge oncoming obstacles. The goal is to survive as long as possible, with the score increasing over time.

## Description

The game presents a track where a player-controlled blue cube moves forward automatically. Pink obstacles appear ahead, and the player must use the left and right arrow keys (or 'A' and 'D') to move the cube horizontally and avoid collisions. The camera angle can be adjusted by clicking and dragging, and zooming is possible with the mouse wheel or trackpad gestures. The game ends when the player collides with an obstacle.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface components (start button, score display, instructions).
- **Babylon.js:** A powerful WebGL-based 3D graphics engine used for rendering the game scene, player, obstacles, and handling game logic like movement and collision detection.
- **SCSS:** For styling the UI components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** The primary programming language for the game logic and UI interactions.
- **Create React App:** Used as the initial project setup and build toolchain.
